# **Practical Exercise - Foundations of MLOps**
### Gregorio Mendoza Serrano

## 1. Objective
The objective of this exercise is to get familiar with the MLOps process followed in a practical use case by analyzing and implementing the phases of an MLOps project.

## 2. Statement
1. Review the code of the exercise to understand the successive phases of the MLOps cycle through which it goes.
2. Generate a text document where you explain the correspondence between the MLOps phases and the code snippets, that is, which code snippets correspond to which phase. 
3. How would you modify the code to improve the results? Are you able to extract any conclusions from the data that are not reflected in the initial code? 

The above steps are implemented in the accompanying Jupyter Notebook.
